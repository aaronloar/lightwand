lightwand version 2.0
=========

Lightwand project

This project originated as an experiment to control WS2812B serially-addressable RGB LEDs with the ST Micro project board, STM32VLDiscovery.  It is a STM32F100 project board with the ST Link board built in.

The lightwand itself was later re-factored to work with an Arduino because of the space and power requirements of the project.  A full writeup can be found at www.aaronloar.com

This repository exists as a backup of the original code written by myself and by Donald Bartley.

The Arduino code is available at www.github.com/aaronloar/lightwand2
